## BowlsNet Reports

This repository contains the crown green bowling league reports for many different leagues in the Yorkshire area. The reports are automatically generated from the BowlsNet website.

The league reports are organized by year and league. They can be found in the `bowlsnetReports` directory.

The reports are automatically updated every Sunday evening. You can check when the report was generated by looking at the league report file and checking the top line, which contains the date of the report generation.

Extra leagues information can be added if required, please contact `stanningleybowlsclub@gmail.com` to request additional leagues.

## Running the script to scrape reports

This repository also contains the league reports scraper for BowlsNet. The scraper is built using Node.js and Playwright, allowing it to navigate the website and extract report data.

This script is designed to scrape reports from the BowlsNet website for various leagues and save them in a structured format. The reports are organized by year and league, and the script can handle multiple leagues.
To run the script, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. `npm install`
2. `npx playwright install --with-deps`
3. `npm run get-reports`

This will scrape the reports from the specified leagues and save them in the `bowlsnetReports/{year}` directory.
